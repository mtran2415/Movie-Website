    <td>27.1</td>

    <td>9.56</td>
    <td>This is much faster than the Single Instance version of this case for the same reason as Case 1: load is getting redistributed, so the intensity of the workload isn't so high, allowing greater throughput. Slower than scaled 1 thread since there are more user connections.</td>
