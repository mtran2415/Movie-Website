We use the LIKE predicate in our SearchServlet. In it, we create a base string that contains a query that has a parameter (%s) that can be replaced later to add new conditions to the query. After creating the base query, we have a bunch of if statements to check the submitted search form to see what the user typed in for title, year, director, and/or stars. Depending on which combination of them were filled in, we added these new conditions to the base query. Specifically, we would surround what the user typed in for title, director, and/or star with % at the beginning and end and add that to the base query. For example, if the user typed in "God" for the title, the condition "and '%God%'" would be added to the query. Surrounding the user input with % on both sides allows us to search for all movies that have that input in its title. This substring matching goes for the other parts of the form that the user inputs except for year.
