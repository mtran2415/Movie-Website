# Movie-Website
This is a website I created for a UCI project course in databases and web applications. Specifically, it is an e-commerce website to sell movies. The website's backend was designed with Java, MySql, and JDBC. The website's front-end was designed with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.
