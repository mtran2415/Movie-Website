# Movie-Website
This is a website I created for a project course in databases and web applications at UCI. Specifically, it is an e-commerce website to sell movies. The website's backend was designed with Java, MySQL, and JDBC. The website's front-end was designed with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.
